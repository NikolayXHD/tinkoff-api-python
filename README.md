# A python http client for [Tinkoff OpenAPI](https://tinkoffcreditsystems.github.io/invest-openapi/)

In order to use it you need to have a broker account in [Tinkoff Bank](https://www.tinkoff.ru/)

Generated from [official swagger docs](https://tinkoffcreditsystems.github.io/invest-openapi/swagger-ui/), then heavily polished to fix python3 type checking and properly implement enumeration types in models.

I use this client myself as a part of stock trading bot which manages my portfolio.

If you use it, and improve it for yourself, please consider sharing your work here in a form of Pull Request.

By developing it together we distribute the burden between multiple people, it's a clear win-win.

Have a nice day!
